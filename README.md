# 60DaysOfCode_DSA

Note : This is not a compulsory challenge, it's totally optional for all the mentees .
For 60 days, we are supposed to solve programming questions on either GFG or Leetcode and then you have to submit your codes in a github repository where you will be added as collaborator. There are no exceptions for Practicals , college assignments or anything .
Please read the points below if you are opting for it.
Workflow :

  You will be added as collaborator on Github Repo.
    Make folders with your name in the specific format ( i.e , Parth_2026) which means Parth from Batch of 2026.
    You will daily copy codes of all the questions solved (at least 1 ques must be solved every day) in a file, it can be a notepad .txt file or .cpp/.java/.py files and push the codes in your respective folders only.
    The file names must contain only the date of the day on which these questions are solved.
    Solve questions on a single platform only as it will improve your heatmap on coding profiles showing consistency.
    After 60 Days, all those who have sincerely completed the challenge might get a shout out on linkedin by Anveshan . (Don't do it for the shoutout, but do it if you want to challenge yourself.)
    I am concerned about your academic workload so, If in case due to some unavoidable situation or work load, you are not able to push code or solve one questions on a day, then you have to compensate with 2 questions the next time you push codes. ( You must inform your mentor in the group itself before doing this. For example : If I could not solve 1 question / push my code on 10th March due to some genuine reason, then I must solve 2 questions to compensate it and upload these 2 codes in a file with name as the date of 10th March, the next time I push my codes. ) 


Happy Coding :)
